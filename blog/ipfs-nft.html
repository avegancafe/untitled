    <h2>UNTITLED</h2>
    <h1>Deploying an IPFS-Backed NFT</h1>
    <p>Mar 1, 2022</p>
    <p><i>Reflections about my experience creating and deploying an NFT</i></p>
    <p>
      There are many ways to deploy NFTs. You can host assets on your own
      servers, post images only, have attributes attached, etc. This blog post
      will go into the most typical setup I’ve seen for a project, that being:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Images uploaded on IPFS</li>
      <li>JSON metadata hosted on IPFS</li>
      <li>Contract hand-made (in solidity, duh)</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>TL;DR</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Write the solidity contract</li>
      <li>Upload images to Pinata</li>
      <li>Upload JSON data to Pinata</li>
      <li>Deploy contract to rinkeby</li>
      <li>Verify contract on rinkeby</li>
      <li>
        Set your baseTokenURI to
        <code>ipfs://&lt;your json folder CID&gt;/</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        List your project on OpenSea:
        <a href="https://testnets.opensea.io/get-listed"
          >https://testnets.opensea.io/get-listed</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Before getting started, I’ve pushed all of my code to this public template
      here:
      <a href="https://github.com/keyboard-clacker/ERC-721"
        >https://github.com/keyboard-clacker/ERC-721</a
      >
      Feel free to use this as your base starting point — you should probably
      not have to modify this code beyond a few lines like your IPFS CID or NFT
      name/ticker, unless you want added functionality in your contract.
    </p>

    <h3>Writing Your Contract</h3>

    <p>
      There really isn’t anything special here you have to worry about. I used a
      typical OpenZeppelin setup that has basically no custom code here. In case
      you want a boilerplate to start off with, here ya go:
    </p>
    <pre>
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol";
contract TestContract is ERC721Enumerable, Ownable {
	using SafeMath for uint256;
	using Counters for Counters.Counter;
	Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
	uint public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 100;
	uint public constant PRICE = 0.01 ether;
	uint public constant MAX_PER_MINT = 5;
	string public baseTokenURI;
	constructor(string memory baseURI) ERC721("Test Contract", "NFTC") {
		setBaseURI(baseURI);
	}
	function reserveNFTs() public onlyOwner {
		uint totalMinted = _tokenIds.current();
		require(totalMinted.add(3) < MAX_SUPPLY, "Not enough NFTs left to reserve");
		for (uint i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			_mintSingleNFT();
		}
	}
	function _baseURI() internal view virtual override returns (string memory) {
		return baseTokenURI;
	}
	function setBaseURI(string memory _baseTokenURI) public onlyOwner {
		baseTokenURI = _baseTokenURI;
	}
	function mintNFTs(uint _count) public payable {
		uint totalMinted = _tokenIds.current();
		require(totalMinted.add(_count) <= MAX_SUPPLY, "Not enough NFTs left!");
		require(_count >0 && _count <= MAX_PER_MINT, "Cannot mint specified number of NFTs.");
		require(msg.value >= PRICE.mul(_count), "Not enough ether to purchase NFTs.");
		for (uint i = 0; i < _count; i++) {
			_mintSingleNFT();
		}
	}
	function _mintSingleNFT() private {
		uint newTokenID = _tokenIds.current();
		_safeMint(msg.sender, newTokenID);
		_tokenIds.increment();
	}
	function tokensOfOwner(address _owner) external view returns (uint[] memory) {
		uint tokenCount = balanceOf(_owner);
		uint[] memory tokensId = new uint256[](tokenCount);
		for (uint i = 0; i < tokenCount; i++) {
			tokensId[i] = tokenOfOwnerByIndex(_owner, i);
		}
		return tokensId;
	}
	function withdraw() public payable onlyOwner {
		uint balance = address(this).balance;
		require(balance > 0, "No ether left to withdraw");
		(bool success, ) = (msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");
		require(success, "Transfer failed.");
	}
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      I recommend using hardhat to deploy this, since you can also use it to
      verify your contract pretty easily (easier a time than I had with
      truffle). For this, I used <code>@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan</code>,
      which requires you to create an etherscan API key, but this can be done
      very easily and freely here, as long as you have an etherscan account:
      <a href="https://etherscan.io/myapikey">https://etherscan.io/myapikey</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As for your hardhat configuration, you need very little special stuff here
      as well. Here is what I’m using, I really only added that etherscan import
      to the top, which registers the <code>verify</code> command, but that’s
      basically it.
    </p>
    <pre>
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan");
require('dotenv').config();
const { API_URL, PRIVATE_KEY, ETHERSCAN_API_KEY } = process.env;
// This is a sample Hardhat task. To learn how to create your own go to
// <https://hardhat.org/guides/create-task.html>
task("accounts", "Prints the list of accounts", async (taskArgs, hre) => {
  const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
  for (const account of accounts) {
    console.log(account.address);
  }
});
// You need to export an object to set up your config
// Go to <https://hardhat.org/config/> to learn more
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  defaultNetwork: "rinkeby",
  networks: {
    rinkeby: {
      url: API_URL,
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY]
    }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
  }
};
    </pre>

    <h3>Upload Images to Pinata</h3>

    <p>
      I recommend doing this and the following step of uploading these two
      folders to Pinata (or your IPFS portal of your choice) because the base
      URI you pass in to your contract constructor when deploying your contract
      will be the ipfs URL for your JSON folder, and all of those files will
      have image attributes that point to images in the IPFS folder with all of
      the images themselves. So you can really do this whenever you want, hell
      you can set your base URI to whatever random string you want really, just
      when you want to go publish on opensea, probably change it to your JSON
      folder IPFSURI or nothing will work obviously. That being said, let’s get
      into uploading images to Pinata.
    </p>
    <p>
      This step is deceptively simple. Basically what you want to do is put all
      of your image assets in one folder, and upload that entire folder itself
      to Pinata. The reason you want to do this is because when you upload an
      entire folder to Pinata, it creates a CID, or content ID hash that is a
      hash resultant from the actual contents of all of the files within your
      folder. This will let you do something like
      <code>ipfs://&lt;your cid&gt;/1.png</code> or whatever file you want to
      reference in that folder. This isn’t as useful for your images folder,
      since your JSON will be the one pointing directly to each file so it
      really doesn’t matter, but might as well keep it consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to uploading to Pinata. Here’s pretty much the steps you want to do:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Put all of your images in a folder. Doesn’t matter the folder name, you
        can give it whatever name you like later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to your Pinata pin manager dashboard here:
        <a href="https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager"
          >https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>Click the Upload button</li>
      <li>Select the “Folder” option</li>
      <li>Select the folder with all of the image files in it</li>
      <li>
        At the next step, name it whatever you want, it really doesn’t matter. I
        chose the name of my contract, skewer case, and then for the next step I
        did the same and just appended -json to the end of it so I knew which
        was which easily. Plus then they’re in order in the list when sorting by
        name.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That’s it for uploading images to Pinata. Pretty easy, made harder only by
      my lack of conviction for concision.
    </p>

    <h3>Upload JSON Metadata to Pinata</h3>

    <p>
      This was a part that I have found is poorly descripbed/documented online.
      And is also the keystone piece for actually connecting your contract
      tokens to your IPFS assets.
    </p>
    <p>In order to understand this step, you need to know two things.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When opensea fetches data for a token, it’ll call
        <code>tokenURI</code> on your contract with the given ID. If you
        navigate to this URI in your browser, this should eventually be a JSON
        object that abides by
        <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards"
          >the metadata spec described by opensea</a
        >. If it’s an IPFS URI, you might need a chrome extension to check it
        out.
      </li>
      <li>
        That JSON file is nothing special — all it is is a file that abides by
        opensea’s metadata spec, served through IPFS. OpenSea takes care of all
        of the IPFS fetching and all the fancy stuff, for both the JSON file as
        well as the image itself (which also has an IPFS URI, if you’re
        following this guide).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I’d imagine there’s some way here to auto-generate these JSON files, but I
      like doing things by hand before telling a computer to do them for me.
      Gotta build empathy for our future robot overlords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to business. First things first, you want to create one JSON file
      who’s name is just the token number for each and every token. So you will
      have a file called <code>0</code>, then <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>,
      <code>3</code>, I think you get the picture. However many tokens you have,
      you need one JSON file per token. The reason you do not need the
      <code>.json</code>
      file extension is because if you try uploading one of these extension-less
      files and navigate to the IPFS URI, you will see in the headers of the
      response that IPFS is actually automatically declaring the content type,
      so we gucci.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you have one JSON file per token all in a folder together. Note:
      this is a different folder than your image assets. I guess it doesn’t have
      to be, but seems better that way. Separation of concerns something
      something something. From here, you want to upload this new folder to
      Pinata the exact same way you uploaded your images folder. Easy peasy
      lemon squeezy, step done.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a good time to check in. How are you doing, you good? If you have
      any questions, tweet me @kyleholzinger, I am always down to help a fellow
      dev in need. Right about now you should have two folders in your IPFS pin
      manager dashboard, one with all of your image assets, and one with all of
      the corresponding JSON files per asset. If you have this, you are sitting
      pretty. On to the contract stuff.
    </p>

    <h3>Deploy Contract to Rinkeby</h3>

    <p>
      After uploading your assets and JSON files to IPFS, make sure that when
      you’re deploying your contract, you set the baseURI to
      <code>ipfs://&lt;your JSON folder CID&gt;/</code>. You don’t necessarily
      have to, since you probably wrote a <code>setBaseURI</code> method on your
      contract (please do this), but you know what they say, measure twice,
      deploy once. Learned that one the hard way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to deploy your contract to rinkeby, run the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js --network rinkeby
    </pre>
    <p>
      I made my life easier by aliasing <code>h</code> to
      <code>npx hardhat</code>, but it’s your life. Also, do not clear your
      terminal history after running this command.
    </p>

    <h3>Verify Contract on Rinkeby</h3>

    <p>
      After running <code>run.js</code>, it should have spit out the contract
      address of your newly deployed contract. In order to verify this contract
      on etherscan, run this command:
    </p>
    <pre>
npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby "&lt;your contract address&gt;" "ipfs://&lt;your json CID&gt;/"
    </pre>
    <p>
      This might take a second, but should eventually spit out a success message
      after a minute or two. Once it is verified, you can go to
      <a href="rinkeby.etherscan.io">rinkeby.etherscan.io</a> and see your
      verified contract at that address with all its pretty viewable source
      code. Ya love to see it.
    </p>

    <h3>Set your Base URI</h3>

    <p>
      You might not need to do this. Just make sure your <code>baseURI</code> is
      set properly to the IPFS link to the folder with your JSON files in them.
      I repeat, JSON files, not your image assets. The JSON files should each
      link to the corresponding image asset— the top-level asset that opensea is
      requesting for should be this JSON data for each token.
    </p>

    <h3>List Your Project on OpenSea</h3>

    <p>
      I’m assuming you’re using OpenSea here because it’s kind of standard, but
      do what you want. This is what I’m doing. In order to list a project
      that’s deployed to rinkeby on opensea, you have to actually “import” the
      existing token. It’s quite hidden, and used to be in the page that you get
      to when you click “Create”, but they’re greedy bastards and want to take
      all your money so they hide all the good stuff. The page to import your
      own custom contract ERC-721 token to OpenSea is here:
      <a href="https://testnets.opensea.io/get-listed"
        >https://testnets.opensea.io/get-listed</a
      >. You can also use this page to list something on mainnet, idk why they
      don’t know you want to publish to the rinkeby instance given you’re on
      <code>testnets.opensea.io</code>, but whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      All you do here is just give them the address of your deployed contract,
      bada bing bada boom.
    </p>

    <h3>Done</h3>

    <p>
      You should see any tokens that you have minted already from the contract
      (if you did, that is) populating your collection page now. They might not
      have any images showing yet, I usually test it out by going to one of them
      and clicking the “refresh” button in the upper right. If you wait a few
      minutes and it’s still not showing anything, try calling
      <code>tokenURI</code> on your contract with one of the token IDs and
      navigating to that URI it gives you (something like
      <code>ipfs://lkasjdlkasjd/1</code>). It should be your JSON file for that
      token, and if you navigate to the URI specified under the
      <code>image</code> attribute in the JSON, that should be the image you
      want to display on opensea.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s pretty much it, let me know if there’s an easier way to do any of
      this. Congrats on deploying your contract, now you have to do the hard
      part and convince people to like your art.
